**Predicting Song Popularity with Regression**
**Project Overview:**
This project delves into the world of music analytics by predicting song popularity using various regression techniques. Leveraging a rich dataset of musical features like danceability, energy, and loudness, we aim to uncover patterns that dictate a song's success on platforms like Spotify. 

**Key Objectives:**
Data Preprocessing: Utilize KNN imputation and group-based imputation strategies to handle missing data, ensuring a robust dataset for analysis.
Data Exploration: Visualize the distribution of features and their relationships to understand underlying dynamics in music popularity.
Model Building: Develop and fine-tune a regression model to predict song popularity, assessing model performance with metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R2.
**Conclusion:** Summarize insights gained from the data and model, discussing implications for music producers, marketers, or even listeners.

**Tools and Techniques Used:**
Python libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn
Machine Learning: Linear Regression, KNN Imputer
Data Visualization: Custom scatter plots and correlation matrices

**Repository Content:**
Code: Python scripts for data manipulation, visualization, and model training.
Data: Includes the use of a Kaggle dataset on Spotify tracks.
Documentation: This README, along with inline code comments explaining key steps and methodologies.

**How to Use This Project:**
Clone this repository to replicate or build upon the analysis.
Ensure you have the necessary Python packages installed as listed in the setup.
Follow the steps in the Jupyter notebook to see the data preprocessing, exploration, and model training in action.

**Future Enhancements:**
Experiment with more complex regression models like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting.
Incorporate time-series analysis to account for trends over time.
Expand the dataset with additional features like artist popularity or genre.
