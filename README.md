# 🎵 Predicting Song Popularity with Regression

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project delves into the world of music analytics by predicting song popularity using various regression techniques. Leveraging a rich dataset of musical features like **danceability**, **energy**, and **loudness**, we aim to uncover patterns that dictate a song's success on platforms like **Spotify**.

---

## 🔎 Key Objectives
- **Data Preprocessing:** Utilize **KNN imputation** and **group-based imputation** strategies to handle missing data, ensuring a robust dataset for analysis.
- **Data Exploration:** Visualize the distribution of features and their relationships to understand underlying dynamics in music popularity.
- **Model Building:** Develop and fine-tune a regression model to predict song popularity, assessing model performance with metrics like **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R²**.

## 🌊 Conclusion
Summarize insights gained from the data and model, discussing implications for **music producers**, **marketers**, or even **listeners**.

---

## 🚀 Tools and Techniques Used
- **Python Libraries:** `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `sklearn`
- **Machine Learning:** Linear Regression, KNN Imputer
- **Data Visualization:** Custom scatter plots and correlation matrices

---

## 📂 Repository Content
- **Code:** Python scripts for data manipulation, visualization, and model training.
- **Data:** Includes the use of a Kaggle dataset on Spotify tracks.
- **Documentation:** This README, along with inline code comments explaining key steps and methodologies.
